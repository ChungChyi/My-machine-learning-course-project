This is a meteorological prediction model based on BP neural network.
## Introducing
The meteorological data prediction regression model based on BP neural network is established for the meteorological data of Xiamen in the past ten years. 
It comprehensively considers the relevant indicators in meteorological data, and solves a series of potential problems, 
such as the impact of missing data, the impact of differences between data dimensions of different dimensions, 
and the impact of strong dependencies and correlations between dimensions of meteorological data.
